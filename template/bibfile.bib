abstract="We describe the digital biological cell model for microscopic tumor growth module of ContraCancrum project. We present approaches for simulation of basic mechanisms of microscopic tumor growth and response to treatment. It includes simulations of microscopic mechanisms of tumor growth and response to treatment including i.a. avascular tumor growth, non imageable tumor response to treatment, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.",
